# MyGameReview
This is my file in the form of a portfolio from Dicoding about web developer. It is built using HTML as the framework, CSS as the interface, and Javascript as the logic.

### HTML
In HTML, developers use HTML to create a framework using HTML semantics. There is a body, header, aside, and footer. And there are also articles and pictures that make the website more contained.

### CSS
In CSS, developers use CSS to make the website look more interactive. Developers use flexbox to create boxes on websites. There are large picture frames and small pictures as a gallery for each game reviewed. This website can already adjust the display to the smartphone screen.

### Javascript
Developers use useful Javascript DOM manipulation. The DOM manipulation used by the developer is an image gallery. So when the arrow is clicked on the small image, the large image will change according to what was clicked.
